# SCRAPING JUMIA WEBSITES

This project consists of scraping several Jumia sites into one script using Scrapy.<br>


Currently Jumia is one of the biggest e-commerce platforms in Africa. It has several sites that cover several countries on the continent.<br>

Although they have different domains, the sites have the same overall structure. This project consists of recovering the data and the entirety of the Jumia sites in a single script. And to build a multilingual database taking into account the different currencies.
